## Business Understanding
The dataset contains information on 426K cars. From a business perspective, we are tasked to
develope a predictive model to predict pricing of used cars based on various features, such as make, model, year mileage, condition, location, among others.

## Modeling
First model - using only the two numerical features to build a linear regression model
Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error: 98024874.99423555
R^2 Score: 0.21155398282392646

Second model - using all above ranked numerical features and categorical features to build a linear regression model
Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 17041510.93282232
R-Squared (R2): 0.8629295735145145

Third Model - using all above ranked numerical features and categorical features to build a random forest regressor model 
Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 17041510.93282232
R-Squared (R2): 0.8629295735145145

Grid Search - using all above ranked numerical features and categorical features to build a random forest regressor model 
Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error: 20940511.22238466
R^2 Score: 0.8315686434500327

The second model notably surpasses the first one, while the third model surpasses the second one. The grid search model is decent, but it doesn't match up to the third model.
